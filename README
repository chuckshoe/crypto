crypto1.c is the source project file.
The project is written using C99, and it can be compiled using any C compiler 
supporting C99 like gcc,clang etc.

The project has been tested on 
1. Mac OS X Yosemite (compiler - Apple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.1.76)) and
2. Ubuntu 12.04 (compiler - gcc 4.6.3)

INTSRUCTIONS FOR MAC OS & LINUX(UBUNTU)
   1. Place the source file(crypto1.c) in desired directory.
   2. Compile using : gcc crypto1.c -lm -o crypto
      Here crypto is the name of executable generated. You can give any other 
      name if you want.
      If only, gcc crypto1.c -lm is given , by default the name of binary 
      generated is a.out
   3. Run using : ./crypto
   NOTE: both the compilation and execution command should be run from the 
   same directory where crypto1.c is located.

FOR WINDOWS AND OTHER PLATFORMS
Compile and run according to your compiler. See your compiler 
specifications/documents. The compiler should support C99.
As long as the compiler supports C99, project should compile and run.
